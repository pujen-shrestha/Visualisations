## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(rgdal)

geo <- fread("/Users/pujenshrestha/Downloads/AsiaSouthEast-Full.tsv")

geo_2 <- geo[,2]

geojson <- geo_2[[1]]

readOGR("/Users/pujenshrestha/Downloads/AsiaSouthEast-Full.tsv")


```
